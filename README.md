# Clinical Data Management: E-CRF Applications, a Brief Survey 
CDM is the generation of high quality, reliable, statistically robust data from clinical trials. Generated data is useful from drug development to marketing. It helps to evaluate medicines, find answers to the research questions and proving or disproving hypothesizes. In this review, we will explain practices implemented in CDM in order to collect high quality data. We will explain standards and guidelines, processes, and roles with different responsibilities in CDM. Furthermore, we will review and compare different governmental, commercial and open source CDM tools in terms of their functionality.
